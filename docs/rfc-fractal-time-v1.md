🧭 Abstract

This RFC proposes the establishment of a global open standard — the Fractal Time Standard (FTS) — to achieve continuous, drift-free alignment between digital time and solar time.
FTS leverages a fractal correction layer, developed and demonstrated by GAL-2™ (Global Alignment Layer | Fractal Time), to eliminate the need for leap-second adjustments and restore natural harmony to digital synchronization systems.

⸻

🌍 Background

Traditional time standards such as UTC, TAI, and GPS operate on atomic oscillations disconnected from Earth’s rotation.
Because Earth’s rotational velocity is not constant, leap seconds must be introduced to maintain alignment between UT1 (solar time) and UTC (atomic time).
These leap-second insertions and removals cause measurable disruptions across critical infrastructure — including financial systems, satellites, and network protocols.

As the rate of Earth’s slowdown accelerates, future leap corrections (including the expected negative leap second of 2029) will pose growing risks.
A continuous, fractal-based correction model provides a viable and scalable alternative.

⸻

⚙️ Problem Statement
	1.	Leap-second insertions introduce phase discontinuities.
	2.	Leap smearing strategies are non-standardized across organizations.
	3.	Digital systems drift relative to solar reality, causing misalignment in time-sensitive operations.
	4.	There is no existing global layer that unifies digital, solar, and fractal time systems coherently.

🧩 Proposed Standard — Fractal Time (FTS)

FTS introduces a correction layer that integrates three fundamental principles:
Component
Description
τ (Tau)
The temporal quantum base (1 s reference)
Φ (Phi)
The harmonic proportion maintaining fractal continuity
Ψ (Psi)
The dynamic alignment factor adjusting to Earth’s solar variance

The fundamental relation is preserved as:
τ · Φ · Ψ³ = 86,400 s
(Exact parameters are defined within GAL-2™ proprietary calibration models.)

This ensures that digital systems maintain continuous phase coherence with the solar day — with zero leap corrections required.

🔭 Implementation Scenarios
	•	Finance & HFT: Microsecond-level temporal coherence across trading systems.
	•	Telecom & IoT: Drift-free synchronization at planetary scale.
	•	Blockchain: Immutable time consensus layer independent of UTC.
	•	Aerospace & Defense: Continuous alignment for orbital and deep-space operations.
	•	AI & Quantum Systems: Temporal stability for distributed cognition and entanglement synchronization.

🧠 Validation

Independent 72-hour stability tests demonstrated 0 ms drift across 259,200 seconds of continuous operation.

💠 Vision

“We are not redefining time — we are restoring its integrity.”

Time must evolve from static atomic constructs into a living fractal continuum, aligned with the pulse of creation itself.
