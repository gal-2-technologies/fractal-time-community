🕰️ Purpose

Fractal Time Community is an open research initiative led by GAL-2™ to explore the next evolution of global timekeeping:
	•	Fractal-based time synchronization
	•	Continuous drift correction
	•	Solar-digital alignment

Our mission is to unify digital systems with the natural rhythm of Earth’s rotation, eliminating leap-second disruptions and time drift across critical infrastructure — from finance and aerospace to AI networks and quantum systems.

📜 What’s Inside

This repository will host:
	•	Fractal Time RFC (Request for Comments) — open proposal for the Fractal Time Standard (FTS)
	•	Technical drafts, simulation data, and reference models
	•	Collaborative research, discussions, and validation experiments

⸻

🧠 Background

Current systems like UTC, NTP, and PTP rely on atomic and GPS time, which require leap-second patches to stay aligned with the solar day.
As Earth’s rotation slows, these patches become increasingly disruptive — threatening trading systems, satellites, and AI-synchronized networks.

GAL-2™ introduces a fractal correction layer that maintains continuous alignment between digital and solar time, absorbing leap-seconds without interruption.
This represents a new paradigm in global time coordination.

⸻

🔬 Collaboration

Researchers, engineers, physicists, and institutions are invited to:
	•	Review and contribute to the Fractal Time RFC (/docs/rfc-fractal-time-v1.md)
	•	Run independent drift and stability tests
	•	Share datasets, validation scripts, and comparative analyses

⸻

🌍 Join the Movement

This is the beginning of a new temporal standard.
If you believe time should evolve — naturally and harmonically —

“We’re not changing time.
We’re realigning it with creation.”
