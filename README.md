### 🚀 **Welcome to the New Era of Time**

**Fractal Time Community** is the official open-research hub for validating and expanding the **Fractal Time Standard (FTS)** — a new global synchronization framework that eliminates leap-second disruptions, drift accumulation, and temporal misalignment across digital infrastructure.

Developed by **GAL-2 Technologies LLC** in Puerto Rico, this initiative marks a milestone in humanity’s pursuit of temporal precision and harmony with the solar cycle.

## 🧭 **Mission**

To **realign digital time with solar time**, establishing a continuous, drift-free, and living reference for the modern world — connecting technology, nature, and consciousness through measurable synchronization.

---

## 🕰️ **Why It Matters**

Every network, transaction, and satellite depends on time.  
But today’s atomic and digital clocks drift apart from the Earth’s natural rhythm.  
The Fractal Time Standard provides a bridge — a harmonic correction layer that preserves alignment with the planet’s rotation while maintaining the precision of modern systems.

Without this correction, the world faces:

- ⚠️ Leap-second chaos (system freezes, GPS offsets, trading desyncs)  
- ⚠️ Growing phase drift across UTC and GNSS  
- ⚠️ Loss of temporal integrity for AI, blockchain, IoT, and aerospace operations  

**GAL-2™** solves this — continuously, elegantly, and mathematically.

## 🧪 **Validation & Research**

The first 72-hour drift-free experiment demonstrated absolute temporal stability —  
**0.000 ms deviation** over **259,200 seconds** of continuous operation  
on macOS / Python 3.13.  

All logs, hashes, and validation files are public for peer review via Zenodo.  
The community is invited to reproduce, extend, and publish comparative results.
